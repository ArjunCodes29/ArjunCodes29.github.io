                    <h2>Man decided not to steal my scooter</h2>
                    <p><strong>Date:</strong> December 17, 2024</p>
                    <p><strong>status:</strong> draft</p>
                    <p>
                        Today as I was locking my scooter outside the gym, a man approached me. I thought he was going to 
                        ask me for money or sell me something, instead he offered me advice...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He told me to tighten the noose of my lock, and that if I didn't he could pull the scooter right out.
                        He was a bike/scooter thief. Blowing smoke into my face, he told me a little bit about his world: how easy it was to steal bikes;
                        how some scooters were high tech having wheels that spun backwards when stolen; how he could cut through most locks in under 60 seconds etc.
                        He seemed to take pride in how good he was at his job.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        He told me to get a different lock that would work, for a second I thought "ahh so this was a ploy 
                        to sell me something", but he never gave me a link or the name of the lock that would be harder to cut. 

                        He told me that he was actually going to steal my scooter, but for some reason decided against it, he said "you looked
                        like a good man". But he was unsure why he didn't steal my scooter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think it was some mix of his conscience and wanting to show off. (He will still continue to steal bikes like before.)
                    </p>
                    <p> After he was done he was told off ("got shit for it") by his gang. They lost an easy target. He then cycled away.
                        I too scootied away, I did not want to leave my bike there anymore. I'll go to the gym later.
                    </p>

                        <li>The story had so many more interesting details, the sooner I attach a mic to me that feeds everything into an LLM to catalogue my days the better. Will do this this week.</li>
