        <h1>You're Invited to My Birthday Celebration!</h1>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> 29th January (Wednesday)</p>
        <p><strong>8 PM:</strong> Meet at a secret location for cake cutting! (Location will be revealed after you sign up in the form (this is just so i have a rough number estimate))</p>
        <p><strong>10 PM-ish:</strong> Bar crawl begins!</p>
        <p><strong>12 AM:</strong> After-party at my room!</p>
        <p><strong>2 AM:</strong> Event concludes!</p>
        <p>I know loads of you don't drink but feel free to join the crawl anyways or just come straight to my room! If you have lectures and can't stay late, please come for the cake cutting at 8 PM. It's going to be fun, and I can't wait to see you all!</p>
        <p><strong>Other notes?</strong> There will hopefully be just enough cake for everyone. Also if you have a chessboard + clock bring it (bughouse?), and if you have any other games that you think may be fun bring it along.</p>
